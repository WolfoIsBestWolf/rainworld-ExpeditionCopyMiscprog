Ideally report bugs here.
Reporting a bug, in general:

If the mod gave an error on startup, a screenshot of that. 


If the game soft crashed or failed on a menu.  Do not restart your game.
Go to to your game folder "Rain World"
There should be a "exception.log", which is the critical error log.
Restarting the game always deletes this file.
Usually the info in this file will tell what is wrong where and the likely mod culprit.


"Rain World\consoleLog.txt" does not contain any useful information on it's own.
Mods may add their own debug messages, so it can still be useful. 
(I don't usually, beyond seeing if IL code failed)


If something just didn't happen, it can be possible that the mod maker just forgot.
